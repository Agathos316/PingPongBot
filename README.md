# Ping Pong Bot: Explainer document
A bot to respond to ping events with calls to the pong method, of smart contract 0xA7F42ff7433cB268dD7D59be62b00c30dEd28d3D (Sepolia)

**Initialization:**
* The bot checks whether the current bot instance with the given account address is the first time the bot has run on that account.
* If the bot has previously run on the given account:
  * The bot checks for any pending transaction left after the previous bot instance ended, and proceeds to manage this transaction until confirmed.
  * The bot checks the block number at which the previous instance ended, and looks for ping events that were missed during the botâ€™s downtime (in between active instances).
  * If missed ping events are found, the bot adds their hashes to a transaction queue, in the order that the ping events occur.

**Protocol:**
* The bot listens for new block headers and updates the estimated maximum gas price every block.
* The bot adds ping event hashes (either new ping events, or ping missed events) to a single transaction queue.
* The bot processes one transaction from the queue at a time to avoid conflicts or duplicate submissions:
  * A pending transaction is monitored until it is confirmed.
  * A transaction is removed from the transaction queue only once it is confirmed.
  * Network gas prices continue to be updated every block. If network gas prices increase too much, preventing a transaction from being mined, the bot resubmits the transaction at a higher gas price (using the same nonce as the original pending transaction).

**Error Prevention:**
* The transaction queue, current block number, and any pending transaction details are written to storage in real-time, to ensure that if the bot stops, it can restart with all the necessary information to perform the full initialization described at the start of this document. This ensures that no ping events are missed once the bot is running again.
* At each new block, the bot checks whether any blocks were missed (by checking for contiguous block numbers). If blocks were missed, the missed blocks are searched for any ping events. Missed ping events are added to the transaction queue. This is a fail-safe in case of downtime or rate-limiting in the Infura block listener.
* Infura is queried for gas price estimates every new block. Keeping such queries to only occur with each new block help guards against being rate limited by Infura.
* If gas price queries are rate limited, or fail for any reason, processing of new transactions pauses until gas price estimates resume.
* The bot does not allow a new transaction to proceed until the previous transaction has been mined. This helps guard against conflicting nonces, or transactions being frozen in the mempool by prior unmined transactions. This also applies to when there is a new instance of the bot (i.e. whenever it is restarted after a failure). In this case, the bot first checks for a still-pending transaction from an earlier instance of the bot. If there is a still-pending transaction, the bot will only listen for new blocks and ping events, and will not execute any further transactions until the pending transaction is confirmed.
